<apex:sectionHeader title="Social Salesforce using LinkedIn Company Insider" subtitle=""></apex:sectionHeader>

<apex:pageBlock title="Prerequisites">

<apex:pageBlockSection title="LinkedIn" columns="1">
<p>
A <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> account is required that has connections to individuals and/or groups
</p>
</apex:pageBlockSection>

</apex:pageBlock>

<apex:pageBlock title="Setup Instructions">

<apex:pageBlockSection title="Salesforce" columns="1">

<p>
Add widget to Account page
</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit Account Page Layout (Setup -> App Setup -> Customize -> Accounts -> Page Layouts)</li>
<li>Add new section call "LinkedIn Company Insider", ensure it has one column, optionally have "Display Section header On" for "Detail Page"</li>
<li>Add SSLinkedInCompanyInsiderEmbeddedAccount to the new section and set its height in pixels to 255.</li>
</ol>

</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection title="Optionally use another account field other than name" columns="1">
<p>
By default the account name is passed into the LinkedIn widget, you may want to use a value from another field. For example the Account name might be salesforce but you want the LinkedIn widget to search on salesforce.com which would be in another field. To do this -
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create another field on the Account object, for example "LinkedIn Account Name" (LinkedIn_Account_Name__c)</li>
<li>Change "account.Name" in the Visualforce page SSLinkedInCompanyInsiderEmbeddedAccount to the new custom field for example "account.LinkedIn_Account_Name__c"</li>
</ol>
</apex:pageBlockSection>

</apex:pageBlock>

<apex:pageBlock title="Running the Widget">

<apex:pageBlockSection title="LinkedIn" columns="1">
<p>
Ensure you are have already logged into <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> or you will get an "Register or sign in" link within the widget
</p>
<p>
If you are not getting any connections for an account name you can check directly with LinkedIn to see if you should have any. Ensure the account name in the record matches the search criteria.
Go into the "Advanced People Search" in LinkedIn and put the account name (from Salesforce) into the company then search.
</p>
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection title="Space below widget" columns="1">
<p>
The height of the space below the widget is different depending on which browser is used. This is due to the way the different browsers render the widget. To avoid the widget being truncated at the bottom on certain browsers the height for the section in the page layout has to accommodate the worst case scenario.
</p>
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection title="Internet Explorer" columns="1">
<p>
In Internet Explorer if you get the following "Do you want to display nonsecure items" message when running the Widget then do the following
</p>
<ol>
 <li>In IE go to Tools->Internet Options->Security </li>
 <li>Select the ‘Security’ tab</li>
 <li>Click the ‘Custom Level’ button</li>
 <li>In the ’Miscellaneous’ section change “Display mixed content” to Enable</li>
</ol>
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection title="LinkedIn Widget usage" columns="1">
<p>
From LinkedIn's website - Use of the widgets is subject to express terms of use in the <a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/docs/DOC-1202">Widget License Agreement</a>. By using a widget, you agree to abide by these terms.
